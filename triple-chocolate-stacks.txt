smooth the surface. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Set aside to cool in pan.
Step 5
For the milk chocolate cake, combine the milk chocolate, 3/4 cup caster sugar, 50g butter and 1 tablespoon water in a heatproof bowl. Microwave on High for 1 minute or until melted and smooth.
Step 6
Sift 1/2 cup self-raising flour, 1/2 cup plain flour, the remaining dark cocoa and a third of the bicarb in a bowl. Make a well in the centre. Add 1 of the eggs and 1/3 cup buttermilk. Pour in the chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. Pour mixture into 1 prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Set aside to cool in pan.
Step 7
For the white chocolate cake, combine the white chocolate, 3/4 cup caster sugar, remaining butter and remaining water in a heatproof bowl. Melt in the microwave on High for 1 minute or until smooth.
Step 8
Sift 1/2 cup self-raising flour, 1/2 cup plain flour and the remaining bicarb in a bowl. Make a well in the centre. Add the remaining egg and 1/3 cup buttermilk. Pour in the chocolate mixture and stir until smooth. Pour mixture into the remaining prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Set aside to cool in pan.
Step 9
For the ganache, combine the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl. Microwave on High for 1 minute. Stir until smooth. Set aside to cool, stirring often, until thick and spreadable. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the ganache.
Step 10
Use a cookie cutter to cut six 7cm circles from each cake slab. Place a round of dark chocolate cake on a serving plate. Spread with a little ganache and top with a round of milk chocolate cake. Repeat with a little ganache and the white chocolate cake. Spread the top with ganache. Repeat to make 6 cakes.
Step 11
For the chocolate shards, line a baking tray with baking paper. Place chocolate melts in a heatproof bowl. Microwave on Medium, stirring every 30 seconds until melted and smooth. Thinly spread chocolate onto the tray and set aside for 10 minutes to set slightly. Place in fridge for 10 minutes or until chocolate is hard. Break chocolate into shards.
Step 12
Use electric beaters to beat half the cream and the reserved ganache in a bowl until firm peaks form. Place the remaining cream in a bowl and whip until firm peaks form. Gently fold the chocolate cream into the whipped cream to create a marbled effect. Top cakes with the cream mixture, dust with extra cocoa and decorate with chocolate shards.
